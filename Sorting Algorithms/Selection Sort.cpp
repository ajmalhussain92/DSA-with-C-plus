/*

Selection Sort is a straightforward comparison-based sorting algorithm.

Working Principle:
	1. Start with the entire list	:	Consider the first element as the minimum (or maximum)
	2. Find the minimum element		: 	Traverse the unsorted part of the list to find the smallest element
	3. Swap							: 	Swap this smallest element with the first element of the unsorted part
	4. Move to the next position	:	Now, consider the next position as part of the sorted section
	5. Repeat						: 	Continue this process for each position in the list until the entire list is sorted

Time Complexity:
	Worst					: 	O(n²)
	Average					: 	O(n²)
	Best (already sorted)	: 	O(n²)

Selection Sort: Best = Average = Worst = O(n²)

It performs well for small datasets.
