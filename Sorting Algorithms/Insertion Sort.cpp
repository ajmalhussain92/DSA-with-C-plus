/*

Insertion Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the sorted list one element at a time
Insertion Sort works exactly like sorting playing cards in your hand

Working Principle:
	1. Start with the second element	: 	Assume the first element is already sorted
	2. Select the current element		: 	Take the next element in the unsorted portion
	3. Compare and shift				: 	Compare this element with the elements in the sorted portion (to its left)
	4. Insert							: 	Place the current element into its correct position where it is greater than the element before it and less than the element after it
	5. Repeat							: 	Repeat this process for all remaining unsorted elements until the entire list is sorted


Time Complexity:
	Worst					: 	O(n²)
	Average					: 	O(n²)
	Best (already sorted)	: 	O(n)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Principle:
	i) You take one element at a time
	ii) Insert it into its correct position in the already sorted part

	It maintains:
		Left side → Sorted
		Right side → Unsorted

	At each step, one element from the unsorted part is picked and inserted into the correct position in the sorted part.
