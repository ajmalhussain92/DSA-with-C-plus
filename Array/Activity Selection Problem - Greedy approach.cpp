/*

Activity Selection Problem using Greedy approach:
	1. Sort : Sort by ending time
	2. Pick first activity
	3. Select non-overlapping ones


Time Complexity: O(n log n)
	Sorting → O(n log n)
	Loop → O(n)


Activity Selection Problem's Goal:
	Select maximum number of non-overlapping activities.		"Don’t overlap"
	
Job Scheduling Problem's Goal:
	Maximize profit, not number of jobs.						"Fit jobs before deadlines to earn max profit"
